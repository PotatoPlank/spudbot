User Permissions
User permissions on the discord work in tiers. The first tier (Yuengling) allows people to comment in all public channels that are not read-only. These users can not upload any media.

The second tier is the Philadelphian role provides media and nickname change permissions and is automatically assigned once you are a member of the discord for 10 days and have at least 10 comments.

The third tier are verified members (IRLVerified) which allows members to participate in community run events and gives members the ability to comment in <#1114365925601325101>.

The last tier are volunteer staff members that have unique permissions.
